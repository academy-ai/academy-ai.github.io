## Implement a Text Classifier

Update `main.py` by filling up the code placeholders under `TODO` by adding code and replacing the `None` values. Running the following command

```
python main.py -e text_classifier
```

should create a `results/text_classifier` folder where a folder for each hyperparameter an experiment is created, and a results.jpg is created showing a bar chart that compares between these results.
